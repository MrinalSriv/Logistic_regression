# Logistic_regression
## I decided to treat this as a classification problem by creating a new binary variable affair (did the woman have at least one affair?) 
and trying to predict the classification for each woman. Dataset The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with Statsmodels. It was derived from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in which married women were asked about their participation in extramarital affairs. More information about the study is available in a 1978 paper from the Journal of Political Economy.  The dataset contains 6366 observations of 9 variables: rate_marriage: woman's rating of her marriage (1 = very poor, 5 = very good) age: woman's age yrs_married: number of years married children: number of children religious: woman's rating of how religious she is (1 = not religious, 4 = strongly religious) educ: level of education (9 = grade school, 12 = high school, 14 = some college, 16 = college graduate, 17 = some graduate school, 20 = advanced degree)  occupation: woman's occupation (1 = student, 2 = farming/semi- skilled/unskilled, 3 = "white collar", 4 =  teacher/nurse/writer/technician/skilled, 5 = managerial/business, 6 = professional with advanced degree) occupation_husb: husband's occupation (same coding as above) affairs: time spent in extra-marital affairs
